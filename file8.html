    <h1><u>COLLECTIONS</u></h1>
     <h2>Ingoma Yanjye (My Kingdom)</h2>
      <p>nspired by Rwanda’s regal fashion, Moshions presents a collection that speaks class, elegance, and grace of ancient kings and queens. An eclectic movement to pay tribute to the game-changing monochromatic and geometric designs, imigongo, discovered in the 18th century.

The royal sensation makes its way into the contemporary realm; exploring the unmatched beauty of Rwanda’s kingdom fashion.</p>
       <h3>Dream Team: Moshions x Ifele</h3>
         <p>Moshions has collaborated with one of Africa’s best designers to make this collection the best yet.

Ifele, South Africa’s very own, is an iconic sandals brand in that handcrafts leather sandals that hint at the continent’s rich culture, and adorned with modern motifs. The geometric elements from both brands align and correspond to breathe out proportions of timeless fashion.  Ifele is about heritage and contemporary class. Just like Moshions.

his collection is a time machine to unsung heritage, mirrored into the future for a timeless cultural embrace. Laid-back, majestic and dreamy in every pattern.
